\G Print float @i{rf} formatted.  The total width of the output is

\G decimal point is @i{+nd} and the minimum number of significant
\G digits is @i{np}.  @code{Set-precision} has no effect on
\G @code{f.rdp}.  Fixed-point notation is used if the number of
\G siginicant digits would be at least @i{np} and if the number of
\G digits before the decimal point would fit.  If fixed-point notation
\G is not used, exponential notation is used, and if that does not
\G fit, asterisks are printed.  We recommend using @i{nr}>=7 to avoid
\G the risk of numbers not fitting at all.  We recommend
\G @i{nr}>=@i{np}+5 to avoid cases where @code{f.rdp} switches to
\G exponential notation because fixed-point notation would have too
\G few significant digits, yet exponential notation offers fewer
\G significant digits.  We recommend @i{nr}>=@i{nd}+2, if you want to
\G have fixed-point notation for some numbers; the smaller the value
\G of @i{np}, the more cases are shown in fixed-point notation (cases
\G where few or no significant digits remain in fixed-point notation).
\G We recommend @i{np}>@i{nr}, if you want to have exponential
\G notation for all numbers.

\g Return the string for the @i{u}th command-line argument; returns
\g @code{0 0} if the access is beyond the last argument.  @code{0 arg}
\g is the program name with which you started Gforth.  The next
\g unprocessed argument is always @code{1 arg}, the one after that is
\g @code{2 arg} etc.  All arguments already processed by the system
\g are deleted.  After you have processed an argument, you can delete
\g it with @code{shift-args}.

Variable argv ( -- addr ) \ gforth
\g @code{Variable} -- a pointer to a vector of pointers to the
\g command-line arguments (including the command-name). Each argument
\g is represented as a C-style zero-terminated string.  Changed by
\g @code{next-arg} and @code{shift-args}.

Variable argc ( -- addr ) \ gforth
\g @code{Variable} -- the number of command-line arguments (including
\g the command name).  Changed by @code{next-arg} and @code{shift-args}.

: shift-args ( -- ) \ gforth
\g @code{1 arg} is deleted, shifting all following OS command line
\g parameters to the left by 1, and reducing @code{argc @@}.  This word
\g can change @code{argv @@}.

\ Local variables are quite important for writing readable programs, but
\ IMO (anton) they are the worst part of the standard. There they are very
\ restricted and have an ugly interface.

\ So, we implement the locals wordset, but do not recommend using
\ local-ext (which is a really bad user interface for locals).

\ We also have a nice and powerful user-interface for locals: locals are
\ defined with

\ { local1 local2 ... }
\ or
\ { local1 local2 ... -- ... }
\ (anything after the -- is just a comment)

\ Every local in this list consists of an optional type specification
\ and a name. If there is only the name, it stands for a cell-sized
\ value (i.e., you get the value of the local variable, not it's
\ address). The following type specifiers stand before the name:

\ Specifier	Type	Access
\ W:		Cell	value
\ W^		Cell	address
\ D:		Double	value
\ D^		Double	address
\ F:		Float	value
\ F^		Float	address
\ C:		Char	value
\ C^		Char	address
\ |             nothing switches to zero-initialized values

\ The local variables are initialized with values from the appropriate
\ stack. In contrast to the examples in the standard document our locals
\ take the arguments in the expected way: The last local gets the top of
\ stack, the second last gets the second stack item etc. An example:

\ : CX* { F: Ar  F: Ai  F: Br  F: Bi -- Cr Ci }
\ \ complex multiplication
\  Ar Br f* Ai Bi f* f-
\  Ar Bi f* Ai Br f* f+ ;

\ There will also be a way to add user types, but it is not yet decided,
\ how. Ideas are welcome.

\ Locals defined in this manner live until (!! see below). 
\ Their names can be used during this time to get
\ their value or address; The addresses produced in this way become
\ invalid at the end of the lifetime.

\ Values can be changed with TO, but this is not recomended (TO is a
\ kludge and words lose the single-assignment property, which makes them
\ harder to analyse).

\ As for the internals, we use a special locals stack. This eliminates
\ the problems and restrictions of reusing the return stack and allows
\ to store floats as locals: the return stack is not guaranteed to be
\ aligned correctly, but our locals stack must be float-aligned between
\ words.

\ A few thoughts on automatic scopes for locals and how they can be
\ implemented:

\ We have to combine locals with the control structures. My basic idea
\ was to start the life of a local at the declaration point. The life
\ would end at any control flow join (THEN, BEGIN etc.) where the local
\ is lot live on both input flows (note that the local can still live in
\ other, later parts of the control flow). This would make a local live
\ as long as you expected and sometimes longer (e.g. a local declared in
\ a BEGIN..UNTIL loop would still live after the UNTIL).

\ The following example illustrates the problems of this approach:

\ { z }
\ if
\   { x }
\ begin
\   { y }
\ [ 1 cs-roll ] then
\   ...
\ until

\ x lives only until the BEGIN, but the compiler does not know this
\ until it compiles the UNTIL (it can deduce it at the THEN, because at
\ that point x lives in no thread, but that does not help much). This is
\ solved by optimistically assuming at the BEGIN that x lives, but
\ warning at the UNTIL that it does not. The user is then responsible
\ for checking that x is only used where it lives.

\ The produced code might look like this (leaving out alignment code):

\ >l ( z )
\ ?branch <then>
\ >l ( x )
\ <begin>:
\ >l ( y )
\ lp+!# 8 ( RIP: x,y )
\ <then>:
\ ...
\ lp+!# -4 ( adjust lp to <begin> state )
\ ?branch <begin>
\ lp+!# 4 ( undo adjust )

\ The BEGIN problem also has another incarnation:

\ AHEAD
\ BEGIN
\   x
\ [ 1 CS-ROLL ] THEN
\   { x }
\   ...
\ UNTIL

\ should be legal: The BEGIN is not a control flow join in this case,
\ since it cannot be entered from the top; therefore the definition of x
\ dominates the use. But the compiler processes the use first, and since
\ it does not look ahead to notice the definition, it will complain
\ about it. Here's another variation of this problem:

\ IF
\   { x }
\ ELSE
\   ...
\ AHEAD
\ BEGIN
\   x
\ [ 2 CS-ROLL ] THEN
\   ...
\ UNTIL

\ In this case x is defined before the use, and the definition
\ dominates the use, but the compiler does not know this until it
\ processes the UNTIL. So what should the compiler assume does live at
\ the BEGIN, if the BEGIN is not a control flow join?  See the
\ documentation for our current approach.

\ Implementation:

\ explicit scoping

:noname ( wid -- )
    dead-code @ IF
	set-locals-size-list
    ELSE
	locals-list @ common-list
	dup list-size adjust-locals-size
	locals-list!
    THEN ;

\ adapt the hooks

: locals-:-hook ( sys -- sys addr xt n )
    \ addr is the nfa of the defined word, xt its xt
    DEFERS :-hook

    DEFERS ;-hook ;

\ THEN (another control flow from before joins the current one):
\ The new locals-list is the intersection of the current locals-list and
\ the orig-local-list. The new locals-size is the (alignment-adjusted)
\ size of the new locals-list. The following code is generated:
\ lp+!# (current-locals-size - orig-locals-size)
\ <then>:
\ lp+!# (orig-locals-size - new-locals-size)

\ Of course "lp+!# 0" is not generated. Still this is admittedly a bit
\ inefficient, e.g. if there is a locals declaration between IF and
\ ELSE. However, if ELSE generates an appropriate "lp+!#" before the
\ branch, there will be none after the target <then>.

\ The words in the locals dictionary space are not deleted until the end
\ of the current word. This is a bit too conservative, but very simple.

\ There are a few cases to consider: (see above)

\ after AGAIN, AHEAD, EXIT (the current control flow is dead):
\ We have to special-case the above cases against that. In this case the
\ things above are not control flow joins. Everything should be taken
\ over from the live flow. No lp+!# is generated.

\ About warning against uses of dead locals. There are several options:

\ 1) Do not complain (After all, this is Forth;-)

\ 2) Additional restrictions can be imposed so that the situation cannot
\ arise; the programmer would have to introduce explicit scoping
\ declarations in cases like the above one. I.e., complain if there are
\ locals that are live before the BEGIN but not before the corresponding
\ AGAIN (replace DO etc. for BEGIN and UNTIL etc. for AGAIN).

\ 3) The real thing: i.e. complain, iff a local lives at a BEGIN, is
\ used on a path starting at the BEGIN, and does not live at the
\ corresponding AGAIN. This is somewhat hard to implement. a) How does
\ the compiler know when it is working on a path starting at a BEGIN
\ (consider "{ x } if begin [ 1 cs-roll ] else x endif again")? b) How
\ is the usage info stored?

\ For now I'll resort to alternative 2. When it produces warnings they
\ will often be spurious, but warnings should be rare. And better
\ spurious warnings now and then than days of bug-searching.

\ Explicit scoping of locals is implemented by cs-pushing the current
\ locals-list and -size (and an unused cell, to make the size equal to
\ the other entries) at the start of the scope, and restoring them at
\ the end of the scope to the intersection, like THEN does.


\ And here's finally the ANS standard stuff

: (local) ( addr u -- ) \ local paren-local-paren
    \ a little space-inefficient, but well deserved ;-)
    \ In exchange, there are no restrictions whatsoever on using (local)
    \ as long as you use it in a definition

vocabulary environment ( -- ) \ gforth
\g A vocabulary for @code{environment-wordlist} (present in Win32Forth
\g and VFX).

' environment >wordlist constant environment-wordlist ( -- wid ) \ gforth
  \G @i{wid} identifies the word list that is searched by environmental
  \G queries (present in SwiftForth and VFX).


: environment? ( c-addr u -- false / ... true ) \ core environment-query
    \G @i{c-addr, u} specify a counted string. If the string is not
    \G recognised, return a @code{false} flag. Otherwise return a
    \G @code{true} flag and some (string-specific) information about
    \G the queried string.

8 constant ADDRESS-UNIT-BITS ( -- n ) \ environment
\G Size of one address unit, in bits.

1 ADDRESS-UNIT-BITS chars lshift 1- constant MAX-CHAR ( -- u ) \ environment
\G Maximum value of any character in the character set

MAX-CHAR constant /COUNTED-STRING ( -- n ) \ environment slash-counted-string
\G Maximum size of a counted string, in characters.

ADDRESS-UNIT-BITS cells 2* 2 + constant /HOLD ( -- n ) \ environment slash-hold
\G Size of the pictured numeric string output buffer, in characters.

&84 constant /PAD ( -- n ) \ environment slash-pad
\G Size of the scratch area pointed to by @code{PAD}, in characters.

true constant CORE ( -- f ) \ environment
\G True if the complete core word set is present. Always true for Gforth.

true constant CORE-EXT ( -- f ) \ environment
\G True if the complete core extension word set is present. Always true for Gforth.

2constant gforth ( -- c-addr u ) \ gforth-environment
\G Counted string representing a version string for this version of
\G Gforth (for versions>0.3.0).  The version strings of the various
\G versions are guaranteed to be ordered lexicographically.

  This files defines macros for threading. Many sets of macros are
  defined. Functionally they have only one difference: Some implement
  direct threading, some indirect threading. The other differences are
  just variations to help GCC generate faster code for various
  machines.

  (Well, to tell the truth, there actually is another functional
  difference in some pathological cases: e.g., a '!' stores into the
  cell where the next executed word comes from; or, the next word
  executed comes from the top-of-stack. These differences are one of
  the reasons why GCC cannot produce the right variation by itself. We
  chose disallowing such practices and using the added implementation
  freedom to achieve a significant speedup, because these practices
  are not common in Forth (I have never heard of or seen anyone using
  them), and it is easy to circumvent problems: A control flow change
  will flush any prefetched words; you may want to do a "0
  drop" before that to write back the top-of-stack cache.)

  These macro sets are used in the following ways: After translation
  to C a typical primitive looks like

  ...
  {
  DEF_CA
  other declarations
  NEXT_P0;
  main part of the primitive
  NEXT_P1;
  store results to stack
  NEXT_P2;
  }

  DEF_CA and all the NEXT_P* together must implement NEXT; In the main
  part the instruction pointer can be read with IP, changed with
  INC_IP(const_inc), and the cell right behind the presently executing
  word (i.e. the value of *IP) is accessed with NEXT_INST.

  If a primitive does not fall through the main part, it has to do the
  rest by itself. If it changes ip, it has to redo NEXT_P0 (perhaps we
  should define a macro SET_IP).

  Some primitives (execute, dodefer) do not end with NEXT, but with
  EXEC(.). If NEXT_P0 has been called earlier, it has to perform
  "ip=IP;" to ensure that ip has the right value (NEXT_P0 may change
  it).

  Finally, there is NEXT1_P1 and NEXT1_P2, which are parts of EXEC
  (EXEC(XT) could be defined as "cfa=XT; NEXT1_P1; NEXT1_P2;" (is this
  true?)) and are used for making docol faster.

  We can define the ways in which these macros are used with a regular
  expression:

  For a primitive

  DEF_CA NEXT_P0 ( IP | INC_IP | NEXT_INST | ip=...; NEXT_P0 ) * ( NEXT_P1 NEXT_P2 | EXEC(...) )

  For a run-time routine, e.g., docol:
  PFA1(cfa) ( NEXT_P0 NEXT | cfa=...; NEXT1_P1; NEXT1_P2 | EXEC(...) )

  This comment does not yet describe all the dependences that the
  macros have to satisfy.

  To organize the former ifdef chaos, each path is separated
  This gives a quite impressive number of paths, but you clearly
  find things that go together.

  It should be possible to organize the whole thing in a way that
  contains less redundancy and allows a simpler description.

   themselves.

   Some of these direct threaded schemes use "cfa" to hold the code
   address in normal direct threaded code.  Of course we cannot use
   KILLS there.

   KILLS works by having an empty asm instruction, and claiming to the
   compiler that it writes to cfa.

   KILLS is optional.  You can write

#define KILLS

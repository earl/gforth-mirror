\ Look checks first if the word is a primitive. If yes then the
\ vocabulary in the primitive area is beeing searched, meaning
\ creating for each word a xt and comparing it...

\ If a word is no primitive look searches backwards to find the nfa.
\ Problems: A compiled xt via compile, might be created with noname:
\           a noname: leaves now a empty name field

    \G @i{nt} is the primary name token of the word represented by
    \G @i{xt}.  Returns 0 if @i{xt} is not an xt (using a heuristic
    \G check that has a small chance of misidentifying a non-xt as
    \G xt), or (before Gforth 1.0) if the primary nt is of an unnamed
    \G word.  As of Gforth 1.0, every xt has a primary nt.  Several
    \G words can have the same xt, but only one of them has the
    \G primary nt of that xt.
